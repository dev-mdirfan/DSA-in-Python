# Time Complexity
If you want to game from your friend and he lives far away from you and you want that game -

| Algo No.| Input | Algorithms | Big O |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Algo 1 | For 250 KB | You use internet | O(1) |
| Algo 2 | For 60 GB | You visit physically | O(n) |

* As input is increases what affect on algorithm's runtime.
* At a limit when you reached in 2nd algo, whatever your size 70, 80 GB your time is constant.


## Big O
* **Mathematical Definition -** $ O(n) $ is also $ O(n^2) $ is also $ O(n^3) $ in Academic
* **Industrial Definition -** Order of, Minimum is better
