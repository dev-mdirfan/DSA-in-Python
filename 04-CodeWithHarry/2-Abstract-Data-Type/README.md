# Abstract Data Type- ADT
* It is blueprint which gives minimal requirements along with some operations to make Data Structure.
* Minimal Requirement Functionality + Their Operation = Data Structure
* Hiding Details (Don't go for implementation go for their uses)


# Array :
* Arrays are collection of elements accessible by an index
* Contiguous block of memory

| 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
| --- | --- | --- | ---| --- | --- |

* You can resize array
* **Minimal Requirement Functionality :**
    * get(i) -> to get ith element
    * set(i,num) -> to set an element on ith position
* **Methods/Operations :**
    * Insert
    * Delete
    * Add
    * Resize
    * Traversal
* Advantage :
    * Faster Retrieval
    * Faster Updation
* Disadvantage :
    * Insertion (Move all element)
    * Deletion (Move all element)
    * Resize
