## 0.2 Should I By This Book?

The book is intended for Python programmers who need to learn about algorithmic problem solving or who need a refresher. However, others will also find it useful, including data and computational scientists employed to do big data analytic analysis; game programmers and financial analysts/engineers; and students of computer science or programming-related subjects such as bioinformatics.

Although this book is more precise and analytical than many other data structure and algorithm books, it rarely uses mathematical concepts that are more advanced than those taught in high school. I have made an effort to avoid using any advanced calculus, probability, or stochastic process concepts. The book is therefore appropriate for undergraduate students preparing for interviews.
