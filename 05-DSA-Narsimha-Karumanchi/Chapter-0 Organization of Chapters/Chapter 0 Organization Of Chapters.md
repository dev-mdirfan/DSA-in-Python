## 0.3 Organization of Chapters

Data structures and algorithms are important aspects of computer science as they form the fundamental building blocks of developing logical solutions to problems, as well as creating efficient programs that perform tasks optimally. This book covers the topics required for a thorough understanding of the subjects such concepts as *Linked Lists*, *Stacks*, *Queues*, *Trees*, *Priority Queues*, *Searching*, *Sorting*, *Hashing*, *Algorithm Design Techniques, Greedy*, *Divide and Conquer*, *Dynamic Programming* and *Symbol Tables*.

The chapters are arranged as follows:

1. **Introduction:** This chapter provides an overview of algorithms and their place in modern computing systems. It considers the general motivations fo r a lgorithm ic analysis and the va r ious approaches w 
studying t he pci-fo r manec character istics of a lgori t hms.
2. R ecursion and Backtracking: Uecursion is a programm ing technique that allows the programmer to express 
operations in terms of themselves. In other words, it is the process of definin g a function or calculating a 
number by the repeated applicat ion of an algorithm.
For many real-world problems, the solution process consists of working your way through a sequence of 
decision point s in which each choice leads you fu r ther along some path (for example p roblems in Lhe Trees 
and Graphs domain). If you make the correct set of choices, you end u p at the solution. On Lhc oth er hand, 
if you reach a dead e n d or 0 1herwise discover t hat you h ave m ade a n incorrect c hoice som e where a lo n g t h e 
way, you  h a ve to backl rack lo a  pre vi o u s d ecis ion po in t and t ry a  diffe r e n t p a th. Al gorithms  t h a t u se this

can be solv ed by com bin ing recu r s io n with back t racking.
3. I.inked Usts: A linked l ist is n dynamic data structure. T he nu m ber of n odes in a list is not fixed and ca n 
grow and shrink on demand. Any application which has to deal with an unknown number of objects wi ll 
need to use a linked list. ll is a very common data structure that is used to create other data structures like 
trees, gmphs, hashing. etc.
4.    S tacks: A stack abstract type is a container of objeccs that arc inserted and removed according to the last- in - 
first-out (LIFO) principle. There arc many applications of stacks, including:
a.    Space for function parameters and local variables is created internally using a stack.
b.    Compiler's syntax check for matching braces is implemented by using stack.
c.    Support fo r recu rs ion.
d.    It can act as an auxil inry duta structure for other abstract data types.
5. Qu e ues: Queue is also an abstract dttlU structure or a lincor data structure, in which the first clement is 
inserted from one end called us rear (also called tail), and the deletion of the existing clement takes place 
from the other end, callccl as front (also called head). This makes queue as PIFO data structure, which 
means that element inserted first will also be removed first. There are many applications of stacks, 
including:
a.    In  operating systems,  for  controlling access  to  shared system  resources such as printers,  files, 
communication lines, disks ;:ind tapes.
b. Computer systems mL1st often provide a lwlcli11g areu for messages between two processes, two 
program::;, or even lwo systems. This holding area is u s ua lly ca ll ed u /111f fer and is often 
implemented as u queue.
c.     It can act as an uuxiliury duta structure for other abstract data types.
6. Trees : A tree is an abstracl datn structu re used to organize the data in a t ree format sons to make the data 
insertion or dclelion or search faster. Tr ees a rc one of the most useful data structures in computer science. 
Some of the common applications of trees arc:
:l. The library database in u library, a student database in a school or college, an employee database in 
a company. a pnlicnl dnwbase in a hospi1 ul, or busica lly any database wou ld be irnple rn cntccl using 
t rees.
b.    The fil e system in you r compu ter, i. e. fold e r s a n d a ll  fil es, wo uld be s t o red ns n tree.
c .    An d a tree ca n act as a n a u xi li ar y d a ta s tructure fo r othe r abstrac t data Ly pe::; .
