Before going to the definition of variables, let us relate them to old mathematical equations. All o f us have solved many mathematical equations since childhood. As an example, consider the below equation: $$ x^2 + 2y - 2 = 1 $$
We don't have to worry about  the use of this equation. The important thing that we need to understand is that the equation has names (x and y ), which hold values (data ). That means the names (x and y) are placeholders for representing data. Similarly, in computer science programming we need something for holding data, and variables is the way to do that.
