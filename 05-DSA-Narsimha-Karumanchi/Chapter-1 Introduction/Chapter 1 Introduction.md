The objective of this chapter is to explain the importance of the analysis of algorithms, their notations, relationships and solving as many problems us possible. Let us first focus on understanding the basic elements of algorithms, the importance of algorithm analysis, and then slowly move toward the other topics as mentioned above. After completing this chapter, you should be able to find the complexity of any given algorithm (especially recursive functions).
