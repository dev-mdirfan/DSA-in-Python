## 1. Null Graph

A graph is known as a null graph if there are no edges in the graph.

## 2. Trivial Graph

Graph having only a single vertex, it is also the smallest graph possible.

## 3. Undirected Graph

A graph in which edges do not have any direction. That is the nodes are unordered pairs in the definition of every edge.

## 4. Directed Graph

A graph in which edge has direction. That is the nodes are ordered pairs in the definition of every edge.

## 5. Connected Graph

The graph in which from one node we can visit any other node in the graph is known as a connected graph.

## 6. Disconnected Graph

The graph in which at least one node is not reachable from a node is known as a disconnected graph.

## 7. Regular Graph

The graph in which the degree of every vertex is equal to K is called K regular graph.

## 8. Complete Graph

The graph in which from each node there is an edge to each other node.

## 9. Cycle Graph

The graph in which the graph is a cycle in itself, the degree of each vertex is 2.

## 10. Cyclic Graph

A graph containing at least one cycle is known as a Cyclic graph.

## 11. Directed Acyclic Graph

A Directed Graph that does not contain any cycle.

## 12. Bipartite Graph

A graph in which vertex can be divided into two sets such that vertex in each set does not contain any edge between them.

### 13. Weighted Graph

- A graph in which the edges are already specified with suitable weight is known as a weighted graph.

- Weighted graphs can be further classified as directed weighted graphs and undirected weighted graphs.
