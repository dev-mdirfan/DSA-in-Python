## Variables :
Variables names are the placeholders for representing the data.

## Data Types :
* A data type is a set of data with the values having predefined characteristics.
* System/Compiler defined data are called **predefined data type**.
* Structure in C and classes in C++/Java/Python are the means to create our own data type called known as **user defined data type(Non-Primitive data type)**.

## Data Structure :
* Data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

### Classification :
* Two major classification of data structure are :
    #### 1. Linear Data Structure
        - Array
        - Linked List 
        - Stack
        - Queue
    #### 2. Non-Linear Data Structure
        - Tree
        - Graph

## Abstract Data Type :
* Combination of data structure and their operations are known as **Abstract Data Type**.
    #### Example :
    - All primitive data types supports basic operation like addition, subtraction e.t.c
    - The system is providing the implementation for those primitive data type.
    - For non-primitive data types we also need to define operations.
