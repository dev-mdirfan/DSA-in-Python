# 01 Curriculum Walkthrough

- This course explain the concept from basic to advanced so it's advisable to not miss this section before you go to the next section.

1. **Introduction :** The very first section is introductory section in which I explain basic content, such as what is data structure, what is algorithm and why we need them.
2. **Recursion :** This section is really important which is used in many algorithms. So it's very important to learn before deep dive into the data structures and algorithms because it comes up later on in many of our algorithms and there are lots of interview questions about recursion.
3. **Cracking Recursion Interview Questions :** Discussed about most asked in interview questions of recursion.
4. **Big O Notation :** It is a way of describing or talking about the performance of efficiency, we use this section all the time. So definitely do not skip that.
5. **Cracking Big O Interview Questions :** There are many different questions that are convoluted to be.
6. **Arrays :** Different types of arrays such as one dimensional arrays, two dimensional arrays. and we have introduced have the how array represented in memory and have calculated time and space complexity for array operations.
7. **python Lists :**
