'''
Generic Function for BFS traversal of a Graph (valid for directed as well as undirected graphs which can have multiple disconnected components)
-- Inputs --

-> V - represents number of vertices in the Graph
-> adj[] - represents adjacency list for the Graph

-- Output --
-> bfs_traversal - a vector containing bfs traversal for entire graph
