    "\n",
    "- Identifiers in Python are case sensitive.\n",
    "- so temperature and Temperature are distinct names.\n",
    "- Identifier can be composed of almost any combination of letters, numerals, and underscore characters (or more general Unicode characters).\n",
    "- The primary restriction are that an identifier cannot begin with a numeral (thus 9lives is an illegal name).\n",
    "- There are 33 specially reserved words that cannot be used as identifiers.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The semantics of a Python identifier is most similar to a **reference variable** in Java or a **pointer variable** in C++.\n",
    "- Each identifier is implicitly associated with the **memory address** of the object to which it refers.\n",
    "- A Python identifier may be assigned to a special object named `None`, serving a similar purpose to a null reference in Java or C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Dynamically Typed\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike Java and C++, Python is a **dynamically typed** language, as there is no advance declaration associating an identifier with a particular data type.\n",
    "- Dynamic typing means that the type of the variable is determined only during runtime.\n",
    "- Due to dynamic typing, in Python the same variable can have a different type at different times during the execution. Dynamic typing allows for flexibility in programming, but with a price in performance.\n",
    "- An identifier can be associated with any type of object, and it can later be reassigned to another object of the same (or different) type.\n",
    "- Although an identifier has no declared type, the object to which it refers has a definite type.\n",
    "- In our first example, the character 98.6 are recognized as a floating-point literal, and thus the identifier temperature is associated with an instance of the float class having that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Literal\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python literals are quantities/ notations whose value does not change during the execution of a program.\n",
    "- Literals in Python are nothing but a succinct way of representing the data types. In simpler words, it is the way to represent a fixed value in our source code. They can either be numbers, text, boolean or any other form of data.\n",
    "- We have the concept of **constants** in Python as well! They are known as literals in Python.\n",
    "- There are five types of literal in Python, which are as follows-\n",
    "  1. **String Literals :** Single-line String, Multi-line String.\n",
    "  2. **Numeric Literals :** Integer, Float, Complex, Long.\n",
    "  3. **Boolean Literals :** True, False.\n",
    "  4. **Special Literals :** None\n",
    "  5. **Literal Collections :** List Literals, Tuple Literals, Dictionary Literals, Set Literals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Strongly Typed\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strong typing means that variables do have a type and that the type matters when performing operations on a variable.\n",
    "- Due to strong typing, types need to be compatible with respect to the operand when performing operations. For example Python allows one to add an integer and a floating point number, but adding an integer to a string produces error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Alias\n",
