# Searching

- The searching operation is a very important operation for sorting. It is virtually impossible to sort the data without using some variant of a search operation.
- The sorting algorithm will be fast if the searching algorithm is efficient.

## Introduction to Searching

- The searching algorithm is applied to the list of items that are already sorted; that is, applied to the ordered set of items
- The searching algorithm is applied to the unordered set of items, which are not sorted.
